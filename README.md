## Project Description:
This project is a tool designed to simulate random events. It provides users with the ability to specify parameters for different types of events and generate simulated outcomes. The tool can be used for various purposes such as statistical analysis, decision-making simulations, and educational purposes.

## Methods and Libraries Used:
The project is implemented using the following methods and libraries:
- Streamlit: For building the user interface and interactive components.
- Python: For backend logic and simulation algorithms.
- Plotly Express: For interactive data visualization.
- NumPy: For numerical computing and array manipulation.
- Python: For backend logic and simulation algorithms.
